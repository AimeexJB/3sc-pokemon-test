# Pokemon pokedex app using React and the Poki API

This is a code test project from [3 Sided Cube](https://3sidedcube.com).

In this Project I use React Class components and Functional components to:
* Display a Pokemon List on a Dashboard.
* Display a Pokemon page with information on the selected pokemon.
* Search through the Pokemon database.
* Filter Pokemon based on their generation.
* Compare 2 Pokemon's stats.

I have also used Bootstrap and custom css to style the application and display the Pokemon cards. I chose Bootstrap because of their easy "card" styling and container along wiht the custom styling as that is how I would normally style the project.

I used a mix of Class and Functional components to show my understanding of both along with react Hooks. This was a challenge as I have not used Functional components and hooks before so I had to learn the difference between the new hooks and the old class methods. One particular challenge that I aced was when making the Pokemon page, this was because I needed to get the Pokemon Index from the URL but the methods that I was used to using, this.props.match.params, cannot be used in react v6 so I have to find a way around this which I did by using the hook useParams().

As I mentioned during the first stage call, I havent had much experience this past year with React, only some small courses and projects in my own time, so it was definitely a challenge to get my head back into this project mindset but after a couple of hours I started to get the hang of it. 

Some extra features I added are that you are able to go into the Pokemon page to view its information from both the Search page and the Filter page. I did this useing the React Browser Router and specifying the path.

If I had more time for this project then I would like to style it up a bit more to look like the pokedex from either the first season of pokemon or the games. I would also have liked to style the Pokemon info page to looks like a pokemon card. Some functionality I would add in would be the ability to Create a profile and login so that the user would be able to save pokemon to their favourites and create their own teams.
